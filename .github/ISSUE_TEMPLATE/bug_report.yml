A [minimal reproduction](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) is required unless you are absolutely sure that the issue is obvious and the provided information is enough to understand the problem. If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it will receive a "needs reproduction" label. If no reproduction is provided after 3 days, it will be auto-closed.
