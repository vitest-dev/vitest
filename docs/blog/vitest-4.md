## Browser Mode is Stable

With this release we are removing the `experimental` tag from [Browser Mode](/guide/browser/). To make it possible, we had to introduce some changes to the public API.

To define a provider, you now need to install a separate package: [`@vitest/browser-playwright`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitest/browser-playwright), [`@vitest/browser-webdriverio`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitest/browser-webdriverio), or [`@vitest/browser-preview`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitest/browser-preview). This makes it simpler to work with custom options and doesn't require adding `/// <reference` comments anymore.

::: code-group
```ts [playwright]
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import { playwright } from '@vitest/browser-playwright' // [!code ++]
/// <reference path="@vitest/browser/providers/playwright" /> // [!code --]

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    browser: {
      provider: 'playwright', // [!code --]
      provider: playwright({ // [!code ++]
        launchOptions: { // [!code ++]
          slowMo: 100, // [!code ++]
        }, // [!code ++]
      }), // [!code ++]
      instances: [
        {
          browser: 'chromium',
          launch: { // [!code --]
            slowMo: 100, // [!code --]
          }, // [!code --]
        },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```
```ts [webdriverio]
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import { webdriverio } from '@vitest/browser-webdriverio' // [!code ++]
/// <reference path="@vitest/browser/providers/webdriverio" /> // [!code --]

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    browser: {
      provider: 'webdriverio', // [!code --]
      provider: webdriverio({ // [!code ++]
        capabilities: { // [!code ++]
          browserVersion: '82', // [!code ++]
        }, // [!code ++]
      }),
      instances: [
        {
          browser: 'chrome',
          capabilities: { // [!code --]
            browserVersion: '82', // [!code --]
          }, // [!code --]
        },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```
```ts [preview]
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import { preview } from '@vitest/browser-preview' // [!code ++]

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    browser: {
      provider: 'preview', // [!code --]
      provider: preview(), // [!code ++]
      instances: [
        { browser: 'chrome' },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```
:::

The context is no longer imported from `@vitest/browser/context` (but it will keep working until the next major version for better compatibility with tools that did not update yet), now just import from `vitest/browser`:

```ts
import { page } from '@vitest/browser/context' // [!code --]
import { page } from 'vitest/browser' // [!code ++]

test('example', async () => {
  await page.getByRole('button').click()
})
```

With these changes, the `@vitest/browser` package can be removed from your dependencies. It is now included in every provider package automatically.

## Visual Regression Testing

Vitest 4 adds support for [Visual Regression testing](/guide/browser/visual-regression-testing.md) in Browser Mode. We will continue to iterate on this feature to improve the experience.

Visual regression testing in Vitest can be done through the
[`toMatchScreenshot` assertion](/guide/browser/assertion-api.html#tomatchscreenshot):

```ts
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { page } from 'vitest/browser'

test('hero section looks correct', async () => {
  // ...the rest of the test

  // capture and compare screenshot
  await expect(page.getByTestId('hero')).toMatchScreenshot('hero-section')
})
```

Vitest captures screenshots of your UI components and pages, then compares them against reference images to detect unintended visual changes.

Alongside this feature, Vitest also introduces a `toBeInViewport` matcher. It allows you to check if an element is currently in viewport with [IntersectionObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).

```ts
// A specific element is in viewport.
await expect.element(page.getByText('Welcome')).toBeInViewport()

// 50% of a specific element should be in viewport
await expect.element(page.getByText('To')).toBeInViewport({ ratio: 0.5 })
```

## Playwright Traces Support

Vitest 4 supports generating [Playwright Traces](/guide/browser/trace-view). To enable tracing, you need to set the [`trace`](/guide/browser/config#browser-trace) option in the `test.browser` configuration or pass down `--browser.trace=on` option (`off`, `on-first-retry`, `on-all-retries`, `retain-on-failure` are also available).

![Playwright Traces interface](/traces.png)

The traces are available in reporters as [annotations](/guide/test-annotations). For example, in the HTML reporter, you can find the link to the trace file in the test details. To open the trace file, you can use the [Playwright Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer).

## Locator Improvements

The `frameLocator` method returns a `FrameLocator` instance that can be used to find elements inside the iframe.
Vitest now supports a new [`page.frameLocator`](/guide/browser/context#framelocator) API (only with `playwright` provider).

```ts
const frame = page.frameLocator(
  page.getByTestId('iframe')
)

await frame.getByText('Hello World').click() // ✅
await frame.click() // ❌ Not available
```

Every locator now exposes a `length` property, allowing them to be used with `toHaveLength` matcher automatically:

```ts
await expect.element(page.getByText('Item')).toHaveLength(3)
```

## Improved Debugging

The [vscode extension](https://vitest.dev/vscode) now supports "Debug Test" button when running browser tests.

If you prefer configuring the debug options yourself, you can start Vitest with the `--inspect` flag (available with `playwright` and `webdriverio`) and connect to [DevTools](chrome://inspect/) manually. In this case Vitest will also disable the new [`trackUnhandledErrors`](/guide/browser/config#browser-trackunhandlederrors) option automatically.

## Type-Aware Hooks

When using `test.extend` with lifecycle hooks like `beforeEach` and `afterEach`, you can now reference them directly on the returned `test` object:

```ts
import { test as baseTest } from 'vitest'

const test = baseTest.extend<{
  todos: number[]
}>({
  todos: async ({}, use) => {
    await use([])
  },
})

// Unlike global hooks, these hooks are aware of the extended context
test.beforeEach(({ todos }) => {
  todos.push(1)
})

test.afterEach(({ todos }) => {
  console.log(todos)
})
```

## `expect.assert`

Vitest has always exported [Chai's `assert`](https://www.chaijs.com/api/assert/), but sometimes using it was inconvenient because many modules have the same export.

Now Vitest exposes the same method on `expect` for an easy access. This is especially useful if you need to narrow down the type, since `expect.to*` methods do not support that:

```ts
interface Cat {
  __type: 'Cat'
  mew(): void
}
interface Dog {
  __type: 'Dog'
  bark(): void
}
type Animal = Cat | Dog

const animal: Animal = { __type: 'Dog', bark: () => {} }

expect.assert(animal.__type === 'Dog')
// does not show a type error!
expect(animal.bark()).toBeUndefined()
```

## `expect.schemaMatching`

Vitest 4 introduces a new asymmetric matcher called `expect.schemaMatching`. It accepts a [Standard Schema v1](https://standardschema.dev/) object and validates values against it, passing the assertion when the value conforms to the schema.

As a reminder, asymmetric matchers can be used in all `expect` matchers that check equality, including `toEqual`, `toStrictEqual`, `toMatchObject`, `toContainEqual`, `toThrowError`, `toHaveBeenCalledWith`, `toHaveReturnedWith` and `toHaveBeenResolvedWith`.

```ts
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { z } from 'zod'
import * as v from 'valibot'
import { type } from 'arktype'

test('email validation', () => {
  const user = { email: 'john@example.com' }

  // using Zod
  expect(user).toEqual({
    email: expect.schemaMatching(z.string().email()),
  })

  // using Valibot
  expect(user).toEqual({
    email: expect.schemaMatching(v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()))
  })

  // using ArkType
  expect(user).toEqual({
    email: expect.schemaMatching(type('string.email')),
  })
})
```

## Reporter Updates

The `basic` reporter was removed. You can use the `default` reporter with `summary: false` instead:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    reporters: [
      ['default', { summary: false }],
    ],
  },
})
```

The [`default`](/guide/reporters#default-reporter) reporter now only prints tests in a tree if there is only one test file running. If you want to always see tests printed as a tree, you can use a new [`tree`](/guide/reporters#tree-reporter) reporter.

The [`verbose`](/guide/reporters#verbose-reporter) reporter now always prints tests one by one when they are finished. Previously, this was done only in CI, and locally `verbose` would behave mostly like a `default` reporter. If you prefer to keep the old behaviour, you can conditionally use the `verbose` reporter only in CI by updating the config:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    reporter: process.env.CI ? 'verbose' : 'default',
  },
})
```

## New API Methods

Vitest 4 comes with new advanced public [API methods](/advanced/api/vitest):

- [`experimental_parseSpecifications`](/advanced/api/vitest#parsespecification) allows you to parse a test file without running it.
- [`watcher`](/advanced/api/vitest#watcher) exposes methods that can be used when you disable the default Vitest watcher.
- [`enableCoverage`](/advanced/api/vitest#enablecoverage) and [`disableCoverage`](/advanced/api/vitest#disablecoverage) allow you to enable and disable coverage dynamically.
- [`getSeed`](/advanced/api/vitest#enablecoverage) returns the seed value, if tests run at random.
- [`getGlobalTestNamePattern`](/advanced/api/vitest#getglobaltestnamepattern) returns the current test name pattern.
- [`waitForTestRunEnd`](/advanced/api/vitest#waitfortestrunend) returns a promise that resolves when all tests have finished running.

## Breaking changes

Vitest 4 has a few breaking changes that could affect you, so we advise reviewing the detailed [Migration Guide](/guide/migration#vitest-4) before upgrading.
