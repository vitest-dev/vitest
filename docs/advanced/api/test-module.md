# TestModule

The `TestModule` class represents a single module in a single project. This class is only available in the main thread. Refer to the ["Runner API"](/advanced/runner#tasks) if you are working with runtime tasks.

The `TestModule` instance always has a `type` property with the value of `module`. You can use it to distinguish between different task types:

```ts
if (task.type === 'module') {
  task // TestModule
}
```

::: warning Extending Suite Methods
The `TestModule` class inherits all methods and properties from the [`TestSuite`](/advanced/api/test-suite). This guide will only list methods and properties unique to the `TestModule`.
:::

## moduleId

This is usually an absolute unix file path (even on Windows). It can be a virtual id if the file is not on the disk. This value corresponds to Vite's `ModuleGraph` id.

```ts
'C:/Users/Documents/project/example.test.ts' // ✅
'/Users/mac/project/example.test.ts' // ✅
'C:\\Users\\Documents\\project\\example.test.ts' // ❌
```

## state

```ts
function state(): TestModuleState
```

Works the same way as [`testSuite.state()`](/advanced/api/test-suite#state), but can also return `queued` if module wasn't executed yet.

## meta <Version>3.1.0</Version> {#meta}

```ts
function meta(): TaskMeta
```

Custom [metadata](/advanced/metadata) that was attached to the module during its execution or collection. The meta can be attached by assigning a property to the `task.meta` object during a test run:

```ts {5,10}
import { test } from 'vitest'

describe('the validation works correctly', (task) => {
  // assign "decorated" during collection
  task.file.meta.decorated = false

  test('some test', ({ task }) => {
    // assign "decorated" during test run, it will be available
    // only in onTestCaseReady hook
    task.file.meta.decorated = false
  })
})
```

:::tip
If metadata was attached during collection (outside of the `test` function), then it will be available in [`onTestModuleCollected`](./reporters#ontestmodulecollected) hook in the custom reporter.
:::

## diagnostic

```ts
function diagnostic(): ModuleDiagnostic
```

Useful information about the module like duration, memory usage, etc. If the module was not executed yet, all diagnostic values will return `0`.

```ts
interface ModuleDiagnostic {
  /**
   * The time it takes to import and initiate an environment.
   */
  readonly environmentSetupDuration: number
  /**
   * The time it takes Vitest to setup test harness (runner, mocks, etc.).
   */
  readonly prepareDuration: number
  /**
   * The time it takes to import the test module.
   * This includes importing everything in the module and executing suite callbacks.
   */
  readonly collectDuration: number
  /**
   * The time it takes to import the setup module.
   */
  readonly setupDuration: number
  /**
   * Accumulated duration of all tests and hooks in the module.
   */
  readonly duration: number
  /**
   * The amount of memory used by the module in bytes.
   * This value is only available if the test was executed with `logHeapUsage` flag.
   */
  readonly heap: number | undefined
}
```
