# Getting Started

## Overview

Vitest (pronounced as _"veetest"_) is a next generation testing framework
powered by
Vite.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Vitest](/guide/why) section.

## Trying Vitest Online

You can try Vitest online on [StackBlitz](https://vitest.new). It runs Vitest directly in the browser, and it is almost identical to the local setup but doesn't require installing anything on your machine.

## Adding Vitest to Your Project

<CourseLink href="https://vueschool.io/lessons/how-to-install-vitest?friend=vueuse">Learn how to install by Video</CourseLink>

::: code-group
```bash [npm]
npm install -D vitest
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D vitest
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D vitest
```
```bash [bun]
bun add -D vitest
```
:::

:::tip
Vitest requires Vite >=v6.0.0 and Node >=v20.0.0
:::

It is recommended that you install a copy of `vitest` in your `package.json`, using one of the methods listed above. However, if you would prefer to run `vitest` directly, you can use `npx vitest` (the `npx` tool comes with npm and Node.js).

The `npx` tool will execute the specified command. By default, `npx` will first check if the command exists in the local project's binaries. If it is not found there, `npx` will look in the system's `$PATH` and execute it if found. If the command is not found in either location, `npx` will install it in a temporary location prior to execution.

## Writing Tests

As an example, we will write a simple test that verifies the output of a function that adds two numbers.

``` js [sum.js]
export function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

``` js [sum.test.js]
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { sum } from './sum.js'

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})
```

::: tip
By default, tests must contain `.test.` or `.spec.` in their file name.
:::

Next, in order to execute the test, add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json [package.json]
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}
```

Finally, run `npm run test`, `yarn test` or `pnpm test`, depending on your package manager, and Vitest will print this message:

```txt
✓ sum.test.js (1)
  ✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  1 passed (1)
  Start at  02:15:44
  Duration  311ms
```

::: warning
If you are using Bun as your package manager, make sure to use `bun run test` command instead of `bun test`, otherwise Bun will run its own test runner.
:::

Your first test is passing! Continue to [Writing Tests](/guide/learn/writing-tests) to learn about organizing tests, reading test output, and the core testing patterns you'll use every day.

## Configuring Vitest

Vitest reads your `vite.config.ts` by default, so your existing Vite plugins and configuration work out-of-the-box. You can also create a dedicated `vitest.config.ts` for test-specific settings. See the [Config Reference](/config/) for details.

## IDE Integrations

We also provided an official extension for Visual Studio Code to enhance your testing experience with Vitest.

[Install from VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vitest.explorer)
