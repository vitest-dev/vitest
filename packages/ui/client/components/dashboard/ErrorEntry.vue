  <p v-if="error.VITEST_TEST_PATH" text="sm" mb-2>
    This error originated in <span font-bold>{{ error.VITEST_TEST_PATH }}</span> test file. It doesn't mean the error was thrown inside the file itself, but while it was running.
  </p>
  <div v-if="error.VITEST_TEST_NAME" text="sm" mb-2>
    The latest test that might've caused the error is <span font-bold>{{ error.VITEST_TEST_NAME }}</span>. It might mean one of the following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The error was thrown, while Vitest was running this test.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the error occurred after the test had been completed, this was the last documented test before it was thrown.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div v-if="error.VITEST_AFTER_ENV_TEARDOWN" text="sm" font-thin>
    This error was caught after test environment was torn down. Make sure to cancel any running tasks before test finishes:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Cancel timeouts using clearTimeout and clearInterval.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait for promises to resolve using the await keyword.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
